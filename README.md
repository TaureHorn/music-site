# ðŸŽµ Vanta Music Site ðŸŽµ

Group final project for [The Developer Academy](https://thedeveloperacademy.com/) Web Dev bootcamp. We were given four weeks to design and create a website using the MERN stack, and our group made this; a mix between a spotify frontend and social media site. Where users can create playlists on the site by searching through Spotify's library using an API, and other users can see, like, and comment on those playlists.
